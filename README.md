Data Sets used in this Project:
- Safety: This data set focuses on all information related to an arrest in the city of Pittsburgh. It contains a description of the person arrested, where, when, and what they were arrested for and varying degrees of specificity of some of these metrics. This allows me to see which neighborhood which crimes were committed in and look at what type of crimes were committed in that neighborhood allowing for the establishment of a safety metric.

- Health: This data set describes various metrics of the trees around the city of Pittsburgh. The trees described are parts of different neighborhoods around the city and the set provides different benefits the trees provide in terms of oxygen, CO2, and their overall benefits and cost. The set also goes on to describe the different types of trees around the neighborhoods and the air quality that the trees have an influence on.
