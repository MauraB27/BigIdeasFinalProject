Data Sets used in this Project:
- Safety: This data set focuses on all information related to an arrest in the city of Pittsburgh. It contains a description of the person arrested, where, when, and what they were arrested for and varying degrees of specificity of some of these metrics. This allows me to see which neighborhood which crimes were committed in and look at what type of crimes were committed in that neighborhood allowing for the establishment of a safety metric.

- Health: This data set describes various metrics of the trees around the city of Pittsburgh. The trees described are parts of different neighborhoods around the city and the set provides different benefits the trees provide in terms of oxygen, CO2, and their overall benefits and cost. The set also goes on to describe the different types of trees around the neighborhoods and the air quality that the trees have an influence on.

- Education: This dataset focuses on school enrollment data in Pittsburgh as captured by the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). It details the enrollment status and grade levels of students, covering public and private institutions, including homeschoolers. The data provides insights into educational demographics across neighborhoods, highlighting levels from preschool through graduate school, and enables analysis of socioeconomic conditions.

- Restaurants: This dataset lists the violations of restaurants in Allegheny County, including what the violation was, the restaurant name,and their city and zip code. This allows me to take the zip code to locate the neighborhood, and add in the violation for my sub-metric, finding which neighborhood has the most violations, and which has the least, narrowing down which neighborhood is the best.
